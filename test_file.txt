There was once a hare who was friends with a tortoise.
One day, the hare challenged the tortoise to a race.
Seeing how slow the tortoise was going, the hare thought it would win easily.
So the hare took a nap while the tortoise kept on going.
When the hare woke up, much to it's chagrin, the tortoise had won;
it had slowly gotten to the finish line while the hare was busy sleeping.
